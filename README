# gaag

Gaag is planned to be a "Genetic Arimaa algorithm generator", however, as of
this version, it is merely an encoding of the rules of Arimaa in Clojure, and
code to display an Arimaa board at the console or in a Swing GUI.

## Usage

Gaag currently has no main function and instead is run interactively in the
development environment of your choice.
